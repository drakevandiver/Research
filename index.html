            <p>The ChipTest project was a project founded by students at Carnegie Mellon University. The students and alumni wanted to create a computer capable of beating even the best chess players. So, they began work on ChipTest. In the beginning, ChipTest was only able to compute about 50,000 possible chess moves per second. This computer was entered into the North American Computer Chess Championship, and subsequently lost with a score of 2-2.</p>
            <p>After the loss, the ChipTest team set out to design a better version of their computer. Lead by Joel Benjamin, the team created;</p>

            <p>ChipTest M was the baby of ChipTest and a new technology, called Microcode. When the ChipTest team was working to iron out any quirks or bugs encountered during the first tournament of ChipTest, they discovered it was far more efficient to use microcode for ChipTest instead of their regular, bulky code. This Microcode enabled ChipTest to process at 10x the origional speed, now computing over 50,000 seperate moves per second.</p>
            <p>With ChipTest M, the ChipTest team was able to beat the North American Computer Chess Championship in 1987. Not only did they win the championship, they blew the competition out of the water. With a score of 4-0, no other team even came close to beating ChipTest M. ChipTest M would have also been entered into the 1987 American Open, however another team from Carnegie Mellon University was also playing in this tournament. As the two teams shared similar code, there were concerns raised about the legitimacy of the two teams facing off at the same tournament. So, ChipTest M stepped down, and a rivalry between the two teams was formed.</p>
