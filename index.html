            <p>The ChipTest project was a project founded by students at Carnegie Mellon University. The students and alumni wanted to create a computer capable of beating even the best chess players. So, they began work on ChipTest. In the beginning, ChipTest was only able to compute about 50,000 possible chess moves per second. This computer was entered into the North American Computer Chess Championship, and subsequently lost with a score of 2-2.</p>
            <p>After the loss, the ChipTest team set out to design a better version of their computer. Lead by Joel Benjamin, the team created;</p>

            <p>ChipTest M was the baby of ChipTest and a new technology, called Microcode. When the ChipTest team was working to iron out any quirks or bugs encountered during the first tournament of ChipTest, they discovered it was far more efficient to use microcode for ChipTest instead of their regular, bulky code. This Microcode enabled ChipTest to process at 10x the origional speed, now computing over 50,000 seperate moves per second.</p>
            <p>With ChipTest M, the ChipTest team was able to beat the North American Computer Chess Championship in 1987. Not only did they win the championship, they blew the competition out of the water. With a score of 4-0, no other team even came close to beating ChipTest M. ChipTest M would have also been entered into the 1987 American Open, however another team from Carnegie Mellon University was also playing in this tournament. As the two teams shared similar code, there were concerns raised about the legitimacy of the two teams facing off at the same tournament. So, ChipTest M stepped down, and a rivalry between the two teams was formed.</p>

            <p>Deep Thought was the program designed by ChipTest's designers to overtake the Hitech team. Despite the Hitech team having a major head start, Deep Thought would quickly overtake them. Deep Thought, named after the computer in The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, was able to analyse over 720,000 moves per second. This was accomplished by combining two of Hsu's custom processors. With Deep Thought, the team went on to win the 1989 Wold Computer Chess Championship without losing a single game. However, Deep Thought soon hit a road block. The team decided to play Garry Kasparov, the best chess player alive.</p>
            <p>In 1989, IBM was exploring the leading edge of Aritificial Intelligence. At the forefront of this community was computer chess, and at the forefront of computer chess was Deep Thought. Garry Kasparov and Deep Thought's upcoming match was big news for months, and IBM decided to sponsor the Deep Thought team. Despite the extra funding, Deep Thought still lost to Kasparov. He kept a cool and tidy game throughout the entire match, eventually beating Deep Thought on game 6. After the match, Kasparov is quoted as saying "The only thing that should be changed about this machine, is teachign it to resign earlier."</p>

            <p>Deep Blue I was formed after the loss to Garry Kasparov by Deep Thought. This computer proved much more capable, and a rematch was soon scheduled. While waiting for the rematch, the Deep Blue team was quickly working on fixes to bugs encountered during Deep Thought's game. On the day of the first match, Deep Blue I came out of the doors swinging, and beat Garry Kasparov in the first game. However, there were still 5 games to go. The second match was declared a draw, with Garry Kasparov and Deep Blue no longer able to make any more moves. However, by the third match, Kasparov had discovered a key weakness in Deep Blue which he would be able to greatly exploit for the rest of the match. Ultimately, Kasparov defeated Deep Blue 4.5-1.5.</p>
            <p>After the loss, the Deep Blue team requested a rematch. The rematch, which was set for a year later, was higly anticipated by the public. This had been the first time a chess computer had beaten the best player alive in a fair game, and they wanted to see what it could do when all of the bugs had been worked out. So. the Deep Blue team set out to make the quickly approaching deadline. Making changes upon changes to the structural design of Deep Blue, they felt they were almost ready to take on Kasparov again. The media had been hyping this game for months, and both teams were ready for the faceoff. </p>

            <p>The match day had finally come, and both teams were ready. Deep Blue had spent a year preparing to face Garry Kasparov once again. Kasparov believed he had the match in the bag. After all, he had never lost a match. Ever.</p>
            <p>Kasparov starts out strong. He wins the first match evenly. However, during the first match, something happened which threw Kasparov for a spiral. Deep Blue had made a move Kasparov could not determine. Deep Blue had moved a Rook to D1, undermining Kasparov's entire game. Kasparov had no clue what Deep Blue's strategy was with this move. However, the truth was, neither did Deep Blue.</p>
            <p>Kasparov's team had reportedly spent the entire night trying to determine what Deep Blue's strategy was in moving the rook. They tried discovering logic where, ultimately, there was none. The move had simply been a glitch in Deep Blue's system, created through a compound of errors caused by not being able to determine Kasparov's strategy.</p>
            <p>For the rest of the match, Kasparov played cautiously. Too cautiously. This mistake ultimately ended up costing Kasparov the entire match, marking the first defeat of the best living chess player. Deep Blue had beat Kasparov at the game he had been playing his entire life. After the loss, Kasparov stormed off the stage, refusing to talk to press.</p>
            <p>Days after the match, Kasparov had began to call foul. He believed Deep Blue's moves were "too humanlike" to be real. He believed an actual chess Grand Master had been controlling the computer for the duration of the match. This was not helped by the fact IBM had destroyed the computer shortly after the match, ensuring the secrets of it would never be discovered. When Kasparov first called for the command logs to be released, IBM delayed for days before finally releasing them. When they were released, it was discovered no foul play had taken place. Instead, it had only been a mistake made by Deep Blue.</p>
